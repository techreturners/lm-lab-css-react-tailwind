## 🏡 Welcome to Marvelous Mansions - A one stop shop to your dream property!

The estate agents 'Marvelous Mansions' recently lost their lead developer half way through their new website design - which has left them in a 'realestate'! 😱

(Uh... "in a real state"... get it?! Nevermind... 🙈)

They have finished their HTML and React, but they ran out of time to work on the visual design.

## 🗺️ The Task

Your mission is to help Marvelous Mansions get their website looking good as rapidly as possible using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

You will need to install Tailwind (see 'Get started' in the Tailwind documentation):
  https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite

Note: you can skip step 1 as your Vite app is already created for you

- You will then need to apply Tailwind classes to the existing React files 🙌

## Getting Started

👉 fork & clone this repository

👉 npm install

👉 npm run dev

## Tips & Tricks

- You will _not_ need to create any CSS files for this task - yay! 🎉

- You're not required to change the React component structure, but feel free to create new components wherever you see fit or move things around! For example, in `card.tsx` it might make sense to create separate components for elements such as a heading component, an image component, etc. It's up to you!

- You can use this utility class cheat sheet to help you: https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/

- You can also add the VSCode extension `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense` for autocomplete and Tailwind support

- Bonus points if you can make the page responsive. Look at using built-in screen breakpoints, like this:

```JSX
// red on mobile, blue on small screens, green on large screens
<SomeComponent className="text-red sm:text-blue lg:text-green" />
```

- Don't forget to check the docs! Tailwind has great documentation - search for the CSS or effect you want to achieve [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)
